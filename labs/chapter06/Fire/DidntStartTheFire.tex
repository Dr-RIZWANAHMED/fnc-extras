The initial-value problem
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fire}
  \frac{dr}{dt} = r^2(1-r), \qquad t > 0, \quad r(0)=r_0,
\end{equation}
is a simple model for the radius of a \href{https://youtu.be/Q58-la_yAB4}{spherical flame ball in zero gravity}. If $r$ is initially small, it grows slowly for a while before rapidly increasing to a value close to 1, which it approaches asymptotically. 

Although the solution is quite simple, it proves to be surprisingly challenging for some IVP solvers, including Euler's method.

\subsection*{Preparation}

Read sections 6.1 and 6.2. 

\subsection*{Goals}

You will solve the flame ball equation numerically using Euler's method, observing its convergence. 

\subsection*{Procedure}

Download the template code and edit it to perform the following steps. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Follow the script to create a high-accuracy reference solution of the problem with $r_0=0.01$. Plot the reference solution for $0\le t\le 500$. 
  \item For $n = 100,200,400,800,1600,6400,25600$, use the
    \texttt{eulerivp} function to solve the IVP with $r_0=0.01$ up to
    time $t=100$. Find the error in the Euler solution by taking the
    difference between its value of $r$ at
   and the reference solution at $t=100$. Make a log-log plot of the errors and verify that the method is first-order convergent.
  \item Repeat part 2 but at time $t=200$. This time, the convergence behavior is a lot less smooth than first-order accuracy might seem to imply.
  \item Plot the solution $r(t)$ over $0\le t \le 500$ using \texttt{eulerivp} with $n=150$, 200, 250, and 300. Even though the errors are getting smaller, these could hardly be called ``good'' solutions qualitatively!
\end{enumerate}
