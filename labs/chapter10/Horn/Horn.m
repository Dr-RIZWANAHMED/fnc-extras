%% WEBSTER HORN EQUATION LAB

%% 1. Analytic case
k = 3;
omega = 6;
L = 2;

%*** Compute and plot the exact solution.

%% 2. FD solution
%*** Compute solution using bvp and plot error

%% 3. Quadratic cross section
omega = 2;

%*** Compute and plot solution for quadratic A(x)

%% 4. Amplitude versus frequency
omega = linspace(0.2,3,100);
ampl = 0*omega;

%*** Solve for each entry of omega 

%*** Plot amplitude against omega.

%% 5. Resonant mode

%*** Compute the most resonant modes.
