Recall that an image may be represented as an $m\times n$ matrix $\mX$ of pixel intensities. A fair way to simulate blurring the image is by
\begin{equation}
\label{blurmat}
\mZ =  (\mB_m)^p \mX \, (\mB_n^T)^p,
\end{equation}
where $p$ is a positive integer and each $\m{B}_k$ is a $k\times k$ symmetric tridiagonal matrix with $1/2$ all along the main diagonal, and $1/4$ all along both the sub- and superdiagonals. As can easily be verified, the mapping from $\mX$ to $\mZ$ is linear, so if we represent the images as vectors (say, by stacking columns), then $\bfz=\mG \bfx$. The matrix $\m{G}$ must be $mn\times mn$, and can be found explicitly, but we consider it to be unavailable. 

Suppose that the image $\mZ$ is derived from both blurring of $\mX$ and some added noise. We can write this as 
\begin{equation}
\label{forward}
\bfz = \mG \bfx + \bfy, \quad \text{for some $\bfy$ with $\|\bfy\|^2=\delta^2$},
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is a small(?) number. Our goal is the reconstruction problem: for known $\bfz$, $\mG$, and $\delta$, return the best (most likely) $\bfx$. An optimization is essential, since there are many possible solutions of~\eqref{forward}. 

Truly random noise will look like static, with lots of value jumps from pixel to pixel. Real images, on the other hand, usually have large patches of slowly-varying values. Consider the $k\times k$ matrix 
\begin{equation}
\mR_k = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  -2 & 1      &        &        &    \\
  1  & -2     & 1      &        &    \\
     & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &    \\
     &        & 1      & -2     & 1  \\
     &        &        & 1      & -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
$\mR_k$ is a scaled finite-difference approximation of the second derivative, so $\|\mR_k\bfu\|$ is a measure of the ``roughness'' of the vector $\bfu$. The 2D equivalent of this process on an image matrix $\mX$ is to apply roughening from both the left and the right, in the form 
\begin{equation}
  \label{roughmat}
   \mR_m\mX + \mX\mR_n^T.
\end{equation}
This too is a linear transformation of the image $\mX$, which we denote by $\m{L}\bfx$ for an unspecified matrix $\mL$. Minimizing roughness, as measured by $\|\mL\bfx\|$, seems like a reasonable optimization criterion. 

We now have a complete problem to state:
\begin{equation}
   \label{consopt}
   \min \| \mL \bfx\|^2 \; \text{over all $\bfx$ satisfying $\|\mG\bfx-\bfz\| = \delta$.}
\end{equation}
This is a multidimensional minimization subject to a scalar constraint function, a problem nicely changed to an unconstrained form by the method of Lagrange multipliers. Introducing the unknown scalar $\lambda$, we obtain the simultaneous equations
\begin{align}
    (\mL^T\mL + \lambda \mG^T\mG)\bfx &= \lambda \mG\bfz \label{lineq}\\
    \|\mG\bfx - \bfz\| - \delta & = 0. \label{nonlineq}
\end{align}

Equation~\eqref{lineq} is an $mn\times mn$ linear system that defines $\bfx$ when $\lambda$ is given. We could pose~\eqref{nonlineq} as a rootfinding problem for $\lambda$. However, we rarely know a good value for $\delta$ in advance, so it makes more sense to regard the solution $\widehat{\bfx}$ of~\eqref{lineq} as a function of a tunable parameter $\lambda$. As $\lambda\to0$, greater emphasis is placed on minimizing roughness (increased smoothing), and as $\lambda\to\infty$, more emphasis is on deblurring (increased sharpness).

The matrices $\mL$ and $\mG$ are never needed for these computations. It's possible to show that $\mL$ and $\mG$ are both symmetric, so $\mL^T\mL\bfx=\mL(\mL\bfx)$ and $\mG^T\mG\bfx=\mG(\mG\bfx)$. For implementation, the multiplication $\mL\bfx$ or $\mG\bfx$ is achieved by reshaping $\bfx$ to the image matrix $\mX$,  applying~\eqref{roughmat} or~\eqref{blurmat}, respectively, and then reshaping back into a vector. Hence, given $\lambda$, the operator on the left side of~\eqref{lineq} can be implemented by writing a function that can be passed to \texttt{gmres} in lieu of a matrix.

A final note: Adding a constant to all the entries of $\mZ$ can improve the reconstruction. A typical choice is to make the mean value of the pixels equal to zero. This doesn't affect the plot using \texttt{imagesc}, which maps min and max pixel values to black and white. 

\subsection*{Project assignment}
\label{sec:project-assignment}

Submit a zip archive with files as directed here. Don't forget to convert an imported image to a 2D matrix of class \texttt{double}. \textbf{You should use \texttt{imagesc} for plotting all images, and after each image plot use}
\begin{verbatim}
    colormap(gray(256))), axis equal
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Objective 1.}] Derive~\eqref{lineq}--\eqref{nonlineq} from~\eqref{consopt}. You will need to consult a calculus book, and to take the gradients of expressions like $\mC^T \mC \bfu$ and $\bfu^T \bfc$ with respect to $\bfu$. 

For this objective, submit the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A PDF, \texttt{objective1.pdf}, typeset nicely or scanned from a neatly written document and showing the derivation in convincing detail.
\end{itemize}

\item[\textbf{Objective 2.}]  Write two functions:
\begin{verbatim}
    function Z = blur(X,p)
    function Z = roughen(X)
\end{verbatim}
They implement the equivalent of $\mG\bfx$ and $\mL\bfx$, respectively, but by operating on $m\times n$ images via~\eqref{blurmat} and~\eqref{roughmat}. In practice, both $m$ and $n$ are small enough that it's not important to use sparse matrices. 
You can test your functions on the image \texttt{checkeredflag} available on the website. 

For this objective, submit the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Files \texttt{blur.m} and \texttt{rough.m}. Each should be self-contained. 
\item Two PNG images. One shows the original and blurred (with $p=2$) checkered flag images side by side, and the other shows the original and roughened images side by side. 
\end{itemize}

\item[\textbf{Objective 3.}] Write a function
\begin{verbatim}
    function y = linop(x,lambda,p,m,n)
\end{verbatim}
The inputs are a vectorized $mn\times 1$ image $\bfx$, a positive scalar value for $\lambda$, and the size $m\times n$ of the original image. The output is $\bfy=(\mL^T\mL + \lambda \mG^T\mG)\bfx$, computed using calls to \texttt{blur} and \texttt{roughen}.

For this objective, submit the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The file \texttt{linop.m}. It should depend only on native MATLAB commands and \texttt{blur} and \texttt{roughen}.
\item A PNG file showing the result of applying \texttt{linop} to the checkered flag image with $\lambda=8$, $p=4$.
\end{itemize}

\item[{Objective 4.}] Download \texttt{fonzie.png} from the website and import it as the degraded image $\mZ$. For $p=3$ and $\lambda=0.05,0.2,1,5$, apply \texttt{gmres} using \texttt{linop} to reconstruct the image $\widehat{\mX}$ (the matrix form of the solution of~\eqref{lineq}).

For this objective, submit the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Four PNG images, each showing one of your reconstructions with the value of $\lambda$ in the title.
\end{itemize}


\item[Objective 5.] Download \texttt{plate.png} from the website and import it as the degraded image $\mZ$. It's a severely degraded image of a license plate. Experiment with $p$ and $\lambda$ and do your best to identify all of the characters on the plate. You might want to use different parameter values for different characters.

For this objective, submit the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item One or more PNG images, showing your best reconstructions for the characters on the plate. The title of each image should show the values of $p$ and $\lambda$ used to generate it.
\end{itemize}
