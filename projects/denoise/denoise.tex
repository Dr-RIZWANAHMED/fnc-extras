  \bf Project: That's one thing he hated! The
  NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!   
\end{center}

Most digital images are captured by a photoelectric sensor array. If
the array is divided into many small pixels, then the number of
photons gathered by each pixel may be small, and random fluctuations
can cause ``noise'' in the image. For our purposes we model noise by
the addition at each image array element of a normally distributed
random number with average zero. Hence for an $n\times n$ image,
\begin{verbatim}
Z = X + sigma*randn(n)/n;
\end{verbatim}

There is no perfect way to remove noise once it has been added. One
solution is to apply a good dose of blurring, but this tends to remove
features of interest as well as noise. Instead there is a method
called constrained least squares inverse filtering. In this model we
have to assume knowledge about the strength $\sigma$ of noise
added. If we write the noisy image $\mZ$ as a vector $\bfz$, we can
describe the result of the process as the $\bfu$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
  \label{min}
  \min \| \mR\bfu \|, \quad \text{subject to} \quad \| \bfu - \bfz \| = \sigma.
\end{equation}
Here $\mR$ is a ``roughing'' operator. It is meant to exaggerate and
thus penalize discontinuities. As is often the case, we find it
convenient to describe and compute the action of $\mR$ on the matrix
form $\mV$ of an image vector $\bfv$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{rough}
  \mR\bfv \leftrightarrow \mD\mV + \mV\mD,
\end{equation}
where $\mD$ is the matrix
\begin{equation}
  \mD = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -2 & 1 & & \\
    1 & -2 & 1 & \\
    & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\
    & & 1 & -2
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
In words, \eqref{min} says the solution to the problem is the least rough
image $\bfu$ that is the same distance from the noisy image as the
original.

As a constrained minimization, equation~\eqref{min} has a solution in terms of
a Lagrange multiplier $\gamma>0$. After some work, the solution is
\begin{equation}
  \label{sol}
  \bfu = (\meye + \gamma \mR^2 )^{-1} \bfz,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is chosen so that 
\begin{equation}
  \label{root}
  f(\gamma) = \|\bfu-\bfz\|^2 - \sigma^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
This is a rootfinding problem for $\gamma$. Note that each evaluation
of $f$ requires the solution of a linear system of equations for $\bfu$.
This system is large and will be solved using GMRES. However, you
don't have the matrix $\mR$, so you will have to use GMRES in its
matrix-free mode. (Make sure you monitor the GMRES flag output
so that returned values are really solutions.)



\textbf{To make this project simpler, choose $\mX$ to be a \emph{square}
  image of size no larger than $250\times 250$.} If you use a
photograph, start with a high-res image and crop to the smaller size
to get a good image. Also use an image with a good combination of dark
and light pixels, rather than mostly black or mostly white.

The structure of the code you need for this problem is shown in the
figure. You need to write 
\begin{itemize}
\item Function \texttt{roughen}, which returns $\bfw=(\meye+\gamma \mR^2)\bfv = \bfv
  + \gamma \mR^2\bfv$ for any given vector $\bfv$. This includes some
  reshaping, and applying~\eqref{rough} two times.
\item Function \texttt{noiselevel}, which calculates $f$ in
  equation~\eqref{root} above after GMRES has been called to find $\bfu$.
\item A top-level driver that defines the images, the value of
  \texttt{sigma}, and the matrix $\mD$ needed by \texttt{roughen}. Once
  \texttt{fzero} has found the correct value of $\gamma$, you need to
  call GMRES one more time to find the $\bfu$ from~\eqref{sol}. The result is the
  method's optimal reconstruction of $\bfx$, which is reshaped to find $\mX$.
\end{itemize}
There are also two ``wrapper'' anonymous functions needed to pass
extra values through \texttt{fzero} and \texttt{gmres}. These are
one-liners like in the earlier project and the homework.

Your goal is to apply noise with \texttt{sigma} equal to $8n$, $16n$,
and $32n$, and then apply reconstruction in each case. Report your
$\gamma$ solution each time (it should increase with $\sigma$ and stay
less than or at least close to 1), and show the noisy and
reconstructed images side by side each time.
